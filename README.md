# GPEngine
A gold parser engine written in fantom.

*This engine is still in alpha stage.*

Things still needed to be done:
* Add support for groups.
* Throw errors with meaningfull messages.
* Write the LALR parser. Basic idea in the test file.
* Create a template.

Also, the code needs more docs any a general tidy up.
